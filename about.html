          <h2>From Infantry to Pixel Life</h2>
          <p>
            After debating about a going to school for art, I decided to
            join the Army as a linguist after high school. Eventually, I
            reclassed to infantry after wanting more of the fight. I
            volunteered for airborne school and Ranger Regiment where I
            suffered a fractured ankle twice (in the same spot!). After
            sitting for weeks, I decided to leave the Ranger program and go
            to the 82nd Airborne where I served in Afghanistan between
            2005-2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon leaving the military in 2007 and returning home, I started
            bartending. This was a key moment of my life that taught me how
            to handle people under civilian-life pressure
            <i
              >(the kind where you can't yell at anyone without losing your
              job)</i
            >. I’m a firm believer that working in the service industry
            helps develop how to actually talk to people in the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This translates into well-honed soft skills that can help with
            selling, satisfying customers, and influencing others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2008 I’ve been working in the online performance marketing
            industry selling downloads, ringtones, weight loss products, and
            dating services. I specialized in landing page design as it was
            what I enjoyed most. Creating landing pages that focused on
            conversions taught me that there’s more to it than just pretty
            looking pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, I’ve learned that certain elements on landing pages
            are best designed one way over another experiemental way “you
            think” might work. That said, it never stopped me from split
            testing different colors, layouts, and images.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now my work is focused on improving and solving key problems
            within businesses through design, marketing, and development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m currently designing the user experience and interface of the
            mobile app for
            <a href="https://shipchain.io" target="_blank">ShipChain</a> - a
            blockchain logistics company based in Greenville, South
            Carolina.

              <h2>My UX Process</h2>
              <p>My User Experience (UX) design process varies from project to project and client to client.  No one 
                is ever in the same stage of development.  The needs and wants of companies can change as swiftly as 
                hurricane force winds. It's up to someone like me to adapt to your business needs and keep your project anchored. 
              </p>
              <p>Before I take on a client, I like to have a conversation about your goals for the project in mind.  This can 
                be a short 15 minute informal get together over beers, or it could be me flying to your office for an in depth discussion about changing the world through your 
                product or service. I want to know your mission statement.</p> 
              <p>Both types of clients are equally important. What matters most is setting goals and expectations. Not 
                only does this make design easier, it keeps everyone focused with the end result in mind.    
              </p>
              <p>If you don't know your buyers, I can assist with user research, persona development and curating the design
                in line with your target customers. 
              </p>
              <p>It's normal for some companies to get lost, lose focus, and lose sight of their intentions. When I'm on your speed dial, 
                you won't have that problem. In fact, you'll stay true to your bearings and goals.
              </p>
              <p>UX design isn't the expensive boat you have, it's the feeling you get sailing the world on it.</p>
              <p>My process is about keeping the design true to the goals set forth by your mission statement and by my honest work. I'm
                adaptable, reliable, and fair with pricing and progress.
              </p>
              <p>No trickery - no outsourcing - <strong><i>no bullshit</i></strong>. </p>
